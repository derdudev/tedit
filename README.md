# tedit

## Description

This will become a powerful online text editor for an amazing website which is still to be published.

## My vision
Have you every visited a website for any kind of research, read some sentence and tought _"well, that's nice and all but where is the source?"_?
Well, I have. So many god-damn times. \
Every time something like that happens you are left with the challenge to 1. find the source and 2. read it and 3. understand it to then finally draw your own conclusion on whether the sentence from the website you visited in the beginning actually is true or false. \
And even if you draw the conlusion that this sentence war indeed true, that whole process is so unneccessary and time consuming which leaves you really annoyed. \
Well, that's exactly why me and my girlfriend started to think about a solution to this problem. \
And that's how we came up with one of the main concepts of tedit.js: It should be as easy as possible to add a source and to reference a specific part of it, even if it's just a single sentence. \

## Features

### Text styling
tedit.js will support all of the text styling you want, e.g. **bold**, *italic*, marking and so much more. \
And for the case it still misses some feature, you can just add it yourself or contact me to add it. \
ˋTedit.jsˋ's library implementation allows for an extremely high customizability and an easy way to implement new features because it is written with not only UI users but also with developers in mind. \
